# TriviaGame
Game in which the user presses "start" and is timed down from 20 seconds while choosing the correct answers to three different questions.  If the user finishes before the timer ends, they can press "done" and their score will be shown.

I used html, bootstrap, css, javascript and jquery to create this game.
